Penguin Quest! is a 2D action platformer game created for CSI 2999 (Sophomore Project) Winter 2021 Semester at Oakland University.
It was created by the combined effort of Eric Wagoner, Elio Zoto, Ruth Wager, and Lucas Stinson.

There were some difficulties exporting the game as an executable, but it runs in VS Code.

To run the game, follow these instructions:
1. Install VS Code and the necessary Java pluggins following the instructions of this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java
2. Download the Penguin Quest! root folder
3. In VS Code, open the Penguin Quest! root folder
4. If prompted, say "Yes, I trust the authors"
5. Open src>Main>Game.java
6. At the top right hand corner of the screen, click "Run Java"
7. If you just get a white screen and errors in the terminal, we will need to re-build the Java Project
8.
