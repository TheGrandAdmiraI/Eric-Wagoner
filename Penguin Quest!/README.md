There were some difficulties exporting the game as an executable, but it runs in VS Code.
To run the game, follow these instructions:

    Install VS Code and the necessary Java pluggins following the instructions of this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java
    Download the Penguin Quest! root folder
    In VS Code, open the Penguin Quest! root folder
    If prompted, say "Yes, I trust the authors"
    Open src>Main>Game.java
    At the top right hand corner of the screen, click "Run Java"
    If you just get a white screen and errors in the terminal, we will need to re-build the Java Project
    Open the Java Projects menu under explorer
    Click the 3 dots
    Clean workspace
    By the notifications (bottom right) click Restart and delete
    It should run now. If not, try right clicking on the "Resources" folder in explorer and add it to the source path if it wasn't already added
